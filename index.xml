The installation went fairly smooth but still required some googling, so if anything this guide might be useful for myself in the future.
The official RPi installation guide requires you to have a SD card reader at hand which I did not so I thought I might use my Android phone instead for the installation of Raspberry OS image.</description></item><item><title>Static site generators part 2 - Hugo</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/hugo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 14:39:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/hugo/</guid><description>Compared to last post about Jekyll I wanted to take a static site a bit further and build my own personal website (this one) so the requirements I had were a bit more defined this time (well, in reality still just in my own head, but anyways). Hoping that I will spend some time on this website as well as ENJOY spending time on it I wanted something:
Easy and fun to work with Responsible UI out of the box Site needs to look the way I want (without me having to put a lot of effort on it) Cheap or free Easy to extend in future Ideally something hip and popular, lets face it.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 14:39:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/about/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Static site generators part 1 - Jekyll</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/jekyll/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 14:39:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/jekyll/</guid><description>Recently I did a low-tech hamstermonitoring setup with Arduino and Grafana. I decided the end result was fun enough to share, and did a blog post/webpage of it: https://oversizedhat.github.io/hamstermonitor
Likely I spent as much time on the webpage as I did on the project itself so I thought why not go all the way and also write about the experience using Jekyll, which was my first time testing out a static site generator.</description></item></channel></rss>
