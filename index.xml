The downside is that you pretty much have to live with, and sometimes fight against, automatic layouting and opinionated visuals (even though some styling is possible). Personally I love it.
How to work effectively with it is however a bit of a mystery to me.</description></item><item><title>Hugo + npm = Awesome?</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/hugo-npm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2020 18:39:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/hugo-npm/</guid><description>Anyone setting up a blog/static site using Hugo is destined to quickly start missing the conveniency of having some kind of build system/package manager at their disposal. The following text describes some basic setup instructions for wrapping your Hugo project with some npm magic and get something that can easily be expanded on depending on the requirements of the project at hand.
If you are looking into using Hugo, my first experience can be found here.</description></item><item><title>semantic-release with npm, travis and github</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/semantic-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Nov 2020 10:01:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/semantic-release/</guid><description>I made up an excuse to try out the popular semantic-release framework/workflow tool for automating release related activities of npm packages. It&amp;rsquo;s been around for a number of years and increasing steadily in popularity last year.
Why use semantic-release? Publishing a package to the global npmjs registry is a dead simple activity. Basically anyone with an email address can set a npmjs account and publish a package within minutes.
npm publish .</description></item><item><title>Setting up RPi with docker &amp; docker-compose</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/rpi-docker/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2020 13:12:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/rpi-docker/</guid><description>I recently bought a Raspberry Pi 4 2GB for random home use.
The installation went fairly smooth but still required some googling, so if anything this guide might be useful for myself in the future.
The official RPi installation guide requires you to have a SD card reader at hand which I did not so I thought I might use my Android phone instead for the installation of Raspberry OS image.</description></item><item><title>Static site generators part 2 - Hugo</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/hugo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 14:39:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/hugo/</guid><description>Compared to last post about Jekyll I wanted to take a static site a bit further and build my own personal website (this one) so the requirements I had were a bit more defined this time (well, in reality still just in my own head, but anyways). Hoping that I will spend some time on this website as well as ENJOY spending time on it I wanted something:
Easy and fun to work with Responsible UI out of the box Site needs to look the way I want (without me having to put a lot of effort on it) Cheap or free Easy to extend in future Ideally something hip and popular, lets face it.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 14:39:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/about/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Static site generators part 1 - Jekyll</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/jekyll/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 14:39:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/jekyll/</guid><description>Recently I did a low-tech hamstermonitoring setup with Arduino and Grafana. I decided the end result was fun enough to share, and did a blog post/webpage of it: https://oversizedhat.github.io/hamstermonitor
Likely I spent as much time on the webpage as I did on the project itself so I thought why not go all the way and also write about the experience using Jekyll, which was my first time testing out a static site generator.</description></item></channel></rss>
