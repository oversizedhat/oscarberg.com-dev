The downside is that you pretty much have to live with, and sometimes fight against, automatic layouting and opinionated visuals (even though some styling is possible). Personally I love it.
How to work effectively with it is however a bit of a mystery to me.</description></item><item><title>Setting up RPi with docker &amp; docker-compose</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/rpi-docker/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2020 13:12:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/oscarberg.com-dev/blog/rpi-docker/</guid><description>I recently bought a Raspberry Pi 4 2GB for random home use.
The installation went fairly smooth but still required some googling, so if anything this guide might be useful for myself in the future.
The official RPi installation guide requires you to have a SD card reader at hand which I did not so I thought I might use my Android phone instead for the installation of Raspberry OS image.</description></item></channel></rss>
