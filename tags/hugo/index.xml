Hoping that I will spend some time on this website as well as ENJOY spending time on it I wanted something:
Easy and fun to work with Responsible UI out of the box Site needs to look the way I want (without me having to put a lot of effort on it) Cheap or free Easy to extend in future Ideally something hip and popular, lets face it.</description></item></channel></rss>
